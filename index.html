                        Birds (Aves) are a group of vertebrates which evolved from dinosaurs. They are endothermic, with feathers.

                        Modern birds are toothless: they have beaked jaws. </p>
                        
                        <p>  Birds live all over the world. They range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.70 m (9 ft) ostrich. They are the class of tetrapods with the most living species: about ten thousand. </p>
                    <p>
                        Birds are the closest living relatives of the Crocodilia. The fossil record shows that birds evolved from feathered theropod dinosaurs.
                        
                        Modern birds are not descended from Archaeopteryx.
